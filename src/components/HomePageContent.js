        <p>
          I am Justin, currently a year 2 undergraduate from the National
          University of Singapore taking a double degree in Computer Science and
          Business Administration. My interest lies in the field of software
          engineering, and I particularly enjoy finding ways to integrate new
          technologies to solve problems. Currently, I am tinkering with the use
          cases of generative AI. I am also interested in Singapore's startup
          ecosystem amd I hope to be able to connect with more people in the
          scene. I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, and
          also at a startup in an AGILE environment using SCRUM framework.
